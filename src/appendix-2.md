# Appendix: Sample conflict resolution policies and procedures

Having clear and effective conflict resolution policies and procedures can help organizations prevent and effectively manage workplace conflicts. Below are some sample policies and procedures that organizations can use as a starting point:

## Policy Statement

\[Organization name\] is committed to maintaining a positive work environment where all employees are treated with respect and dignity. We recognize that conflicts may arise from time to time and are committed to resolving these conflicts in a fair, respectful, and timely manner.

## Procedure for Reporting and Addressing Conflicts

Employees who experience or witness workplace conflict are encouraged to report the conflict to their supervisor, HR department, or other designated individual or department. Reported conflicts will be taken seriously and handled confidentially. The designated individual or department will conduct an objective investigation of the conflict and work with all parties involved to identify and implement a resolution.

## Guidelines for Communication

Effective communication is key to resolving workplace conflicts. To promote effective communication, employees are encouraged to:

- Listen actively and empathetically to the perspectives of others
- Speak clearly, respectfully, and directly
- Focus on the issue at hand and avoid personal attacks or insults

## Mediation Process

In cases where conflicts cannot be resolved through internal communication and problem-solving strategies, mediation may be used to facilitate the resolution process. The organization will provide access to professional mediation services to assist in resolving conflicts.

## Non-Retaliation Policy

\[Organization name\] prohibits retaliation against any employee who reports a workplace conflict or participates in the conflict resolution process. Retaliation in any form will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.

By implementing clear and effective conflict resolution policies and procedures, organizations can create a positive and productive work environment where conflicts are resolved in a fair, respectful, and timely manner.
