# Negative Impacts on Organizations

Workplace conflict can have significant negative impacts on organizations. When conflicts are not addressed and resolved in a timely and effective manner, they can lead to a range of problems that can affect the entire organization. In this chapter, we will explore some of the negative impacts of workplace conflict on organizations.

## Decreased Productivity

One of the most significant negative impacts of workplace conflict is decreased productivity. When employees are in conflict with one another, they may spend a lot of time and energy focused on the conflict rather than on their work. This can lead to missed deadlines, reduced quality of work, and other productivity issues.

## Increased Turnover

Another negative impact of workplace conflict is increased turnover. When employees are unhappy or uncomfortable in their work environment due to conflict, they may choose to leave the organization. High turnover rates can be expensive for organizations, as they must spend time and resources hiring and training new employees.

## Damage to Reputation

Workplace conflict can also damage an organization's reputation. If conflict is not handled appropriately, it can become public knowledge and negatively impact the organization's image. This can make it difficult to attract new customers or clients and can even result in the loss of existing ones.

## Reduced Employee Morale

When workplace conflict is not resolved, it can also lead to reduced employee morale. Employees who are involved in or affected by conflict may feel stressed, anxious, or unhappy at work. This can lead to a decrease in job satisfaction and motivation, which can ultimately affect the overall morale of the organization.

## Increased Absenteeism

Finally, workplace conflict can lead to increased absenteeism. Employees who are involved in or affected by conflict may choose to stay home from work to avoid the situation. Additionally, conflict can cause stress and anxiety, which can lead to physical and mental health issues that result in increased absenteeism.

In conclusion, workplace conflict can have significant negative impacts on organizations. Decreased productivity, increased turnover, damage to reputation, reduced employee morale, and increased absenteeism are just a few of the potential consequences of unresolved conflicts. It is essential that organizations take steps to address and resolve conflicts in a timely and effective manner to minimize these negative impacts.
