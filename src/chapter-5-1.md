# Defining Negotiation

Negotiation is a process of communication between two or more parties with the goal of reaching a mutually beneficial solution. In the context of workplace conflict resolution, negotiation can be an effective tool for resolving conflicts and restoring working relationships.

Here are some key characteristics of negotiation:

1. **Aim for mutual benefit**: Negotiation aims to find a solution that benefits all parties involved. It is not a zero-sum game where one party wins and the other loses.

2. **Voluntary**: Participation in negotiation is voluntary, and all parties must agree to participate.

3. **Collaborative**: Negotiation is a collaborative process where the parties work together to reach a resolution.

4. **Flexible**: The negotiation process is flexible and can be tailored to the specific needs of the parties involved.

5. **Non-binding**: Negotiation is a non-binding process, and the parties are not required to reach a resolution. However, if a resolution is reached, it can be documented and enforced.

6. **Effective**: Negotiation can be an effective tool for resolving conflicts because it encourages open communication, builds trust, and fosters teamwork.

The negotiation process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Opening statement**: Each party provides an opening statement outlining their perspective on the conflict.

2. **Information sharing**: The parties share information about the conflict, including their interests, needs, and concerns.

3. **Generating options**: The parties work together to generate multiple options for resolving the conflict.

4. **Negotiating a solution**: The parties negotiate a mutually beneficial solution based on the options generated.

5. **Closing statement**: The parties summarize the agreement and document it, if necessary.

In conclusion, negotiation is a voluntary, collaborative, flexible, non-binding, and effective process for resolving workplace conflicts. By working together to find a mutually beneficial solution, parties can address their needs and interests while also restoring working relationships.
